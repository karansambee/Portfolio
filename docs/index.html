      <h3>Karan Sambee</h3>
      <p> I am a keen programmer with experience in various programming languages.

        I first programmed used Python for its simplified syntax and emphasis on 
        natural language.
        I have since used Dart with the Flutter SDK to create reponsive, cross-platform 
        mobile apps featuring monetization with banner ads.
        Using the Processing IDE which makes use of Java, I have enjoyed creating 
        programs with an emphasis on the visual side of programming.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Golf</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City, University of London (2021). 

  The aim of the game is to putt the golf ball into the hole, whilst avoiding the moving obstacles.
  This game features an infinite amount of levels as each level is randomly generated.

  This project introduced me to classes and objects in Java, as well as collision detection with differently shaped moving objects.
  For a project created over the span of a couple of days, I am very pleased with the progress I have made in both learning a new 
  language and producing a project at the end of it.

    <h3>Java game using CityEngine: Forest Treasures</h3>
    <p>
      This is my 2D Java game created using the CityEngine.

      The aim of the game is to escape the traps and dangers of the forest, and on your way find the array of coins scattered over 
      the levels.
      
      The main challenge I face during the development of the project was time management. Particularly, estimating how long it would 
      take to implement a specific feature as  bugs and gaps in my knowledge slowed down my coding process.

      The lessons I have learned from this coursework are 
      - The importance of readablity of code when fixing bugs that span across multiple classes
      - How much time is saved through inhertiance as less code is duplicated. For example, my  GameLevel allowed me to created 4 levels 
      effortlessly and my Coin superclass allowed me to quickly create bronze, silver and gold coins with ease.
