      <h3>Karan Sambee</h3>
      <p> I am a keen programmer with experience in various programming languages.

        I first programmed used Python for its simplified syntax and emphasis on 
        natural language.
        I have since used Dart with the Flutter SDK to create reponsive, cross-platform 
        mobile apps featuring monetization with banner ads.
        Using the Processing IDE which makes use of Java, I have enjoyed creating 
        programs with an emphasis on the visual side of programming.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2020: Golf</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at 
	City, University of London (2020). 

  The aim of the game is to putt the golf ball into the hole, whilst avoiding 
  the moving obstacles.
  This game features an infinite amount of levels as each level is randomly generated.

  This project introduced me to classes and objects in Java, as well as collision 
  detection with differently shaped moving objects.
  For a project created over the span of a couple of days, I am very pleased with 
  the progress I have made in both learning a new language and producing a project
  at the end of it.
