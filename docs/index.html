      <p> I am a keen programmer with experience in various programming languages.

        I have programmed in Python to create a desktop application and web app, Dart to make an 
        Android app, Processing to make a golf game and now Java with the City Engine to make a 
        platformer game.

    <h3>Bootcamp 2021: Golf</h3>
    <p>
	My first programming project, concluding the 2 week Programming Bootcamp at City, University of London (2021). 
  <br>
  <br>
  The aim of the game is to putt the golf ball into the hole, whilst avoiding the moving obstacles.
  This game features an infinite amount of levels as each level is randomly generated.
  <br>
  <br>
  This project introduced me to classes and objects in Java, as well as collision detection with differently shaped moving objects.
  For a project created over the span of a couple of days, I am very pleased with the progress I have made in both learning a new 
  language and producing a project at the end of it.

    <h3>Java game using CityEngine: Forest Treasures</h3>
    <p>
      This is my 2D Java platformer game created using the City Engine.
      <br>
      <br>
      The aim of the game is to escape the traps and dangers of the forest and escape through the portals, on your way collecting the array of coins scattered 
      over the levels.
      <br>
      <br>
      The main challenge I faced during the development of the project was time management. Particularly, estimating how long it would 
      take to implement a specific feature as unforeseen bugs and gaps in my knowledge slowed down my coding process.
      <br>
      <br>
      The lessons I have learned from this coursework are: 
      <br>- The importance of the readablity of your code when fixing bugs that span across multiple classes
      <br>- How much time is saved through inhertiance since you are duplicating less code. For example, my  GameLevel allowed me to created 4 levels 
      easily and my Coin superclass allowed me to quickly create bronze, silver and gold coins efficently.
